 ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I am Crista Wathen, Ph.D.
 <p>
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a formally educated Archaeologist and a self-taught Data Scientist. While working as a Research Archaeologist, I realized that how Data Science methods, including analysing data, conducting statistical analysis, creating diagrams and graphs, and machine learning techniques all apply in the research context and the private sector. So I decided to trade my trowel in for a computer and have been using these skills in other sectors, such as a the finance sector. </p>
