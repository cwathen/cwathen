 👋 Hello there! I am Crista Wathen, Ph.D.
 <p>
 🌱 I’m an Archaeologist through my formal education and am a self-taught Programmer/ Data Analyst. I have traded my trowel for a computer and have realized that everything has data. I have been using Excel for 10+ years but have in the last few years been using R and Python to create diagrams and graphs for easy interpretation of large amounts of quantitative data for academic publications</p>
