 ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I am Crista Wathen, Ph.D.
 <p>
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m an Archaeologist through my formal education and am a self-taught Data Scientist. I have traded my trowel for a computer and have realized how everything is comprised of data, and can be applied to the humanities, especially archaeology. I have been using Excel for 10+ years but have in the last few years been using R and Python to create diagrams and graphs for easy interpretation of large amounts of quantitative data for academic publications</p>
