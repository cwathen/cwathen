 ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I am Crista Wathen, Ph.D.
 <p>
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m an Archaeologist and self-taught coder/ data analyst, so my tools are both a trowel and a computer. I have been using Excel for 10+ years but have in the last few years been using R and Python to create diagrams and graphs for easy interpretation of large amounts of quantitative data for academic publications</p>
